# Personal Budget Tracker
The Personal Budget Tracker is a Python-based console application that helps you manage your income, expenses, and budget. This budget tracker provides essential features like income and expense entry, budget calculation, expense analysis, and data persistence.

# Features:
**Expense and Income Entry:**
Add your income and expenses, including descriptions and amounts.

**Budget Calculation:**
Calculate your total income, total expenses, and remaining budget based on your entries.

**Expense Analysis:**
Analyze your expenses by category and track spending trends.

**Data Persistence:**
Your budget data is saved to a JSON file for persistence between runs.

# How to Use
Follow the on-screen menu options to interact with the budget tracker:

1. Add Income:
Enter the amount and a description for your income.

2. Add Expense:
